# Next js project Structure

### 1. App Structure (As Next Js is a framework so it has its own rules and regulations)

Every in next js project , has been moved in src .Inside Src, there is App Directory

App Directory is divded into two portions

1. Backend -- This is named as API
2. Frontend

Models , helpers etc .would be placed outide the app directory

##### API

whenever we are crating any file in API , we would name as route

##### Frontend

whenever we are creatng any file in frontend , we would name as Page

**Very Very Important Middlewares would be placed inside the src directory but not in APP directory**
